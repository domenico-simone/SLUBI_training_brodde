# SLUBI training

This repo hosts materials used for online training and it's awesome.
Have a look at the /notes folder to find the session's notes. You'll find notes per topic where code and notes are edited on the go during the training.


## Install conda environment

```bash
conda env create -n pinus -f config/env.yaml
```

OBS: you need to activate the conda environment before running the snakemake workflow!

```bash
conda activate pinus
```
